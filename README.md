# Text-Recognition-App
Android code that will do the simplest scan of text in real time and display to screen, 
You could use/alter this in your advantage to detect text/ characters from surfaces and use them where needed
The code will read real in real time and the camera will not stop reading.
You may add some logic to your code or even a startActivityForResult to return an answer to your activity if it fulfills your requirements
And that is all,
Remember to add the dependencies while using the code.
